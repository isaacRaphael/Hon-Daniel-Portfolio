                  His life story began when he was born on June 14, 1970, in Opume, Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, Nigeria. His parents, Mr. Robert Sunday Iworiso-Markson and Mrs. Salome Oginasisi Iworiso-Markson (both deceased) left Opume for Lagos in search of greener pastures in the early 1950s but were forced to return to the village when the Nigerian civil war broke out. Immediately after the civil war the couple moved back to Lagos with their new born baby (Daniel Iworiso-Markson) where he was raised alongside  his other siblings.
